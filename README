The script accesses the https://www.spectaris.de/medizintechnik/mitglieder/ page and extracts all the company names. Afterwards it looks up the companies websites and saves all the date for each company. Then it adds all of them to a new csv file

I later asked chatGPT to name me medical informatics companies in germany and saved them in in list.csv
afterwards i read it from the file and applied the same logic to it as i did to the website data.
